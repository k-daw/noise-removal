# Disclaimer: This project is a weekend project.

## The utlimate goal of this project is that, it takes an audio file, and returns a fully-fetched publishing quality audio - or atleast something that is an improvement of the audio quality. 

## For the sake of simplicity - and my personal preferences - the audio files will only contain vocals and no sound of any musical instruments (as this will over complicate the process drastically.)
